A while loop repeats the code inside of it until its condition is no longer true. Show the student an example of a while loop: int i = 0; while (i <= 10) { System.out.println(i); i++; }.

Just like with a for loop, we usually have to create a loop variable first. Then, we update this variable inside of the while loop to help us know when the loop should end.

Again, help the student build an understanding of each part of the loop by changing the numbers and the condition.
  How would we only print the numbers up to 5?
  What about up to 20?
  How would we start counting at 10?
  How would we count by 2s? How would we count backward?

A while (true) {...} loop continues to repeat until there is a break statement in the body. Show the student how to print the numbers 0 to 10 using this type of while loop.
