Using a for loop, print the numbers from 1 to 10.

Using a for loop, print the even numbers from 2 to 10.

Using a for loop, print the numbers from 10 to 1.

Using a for loop (and an extra variable), find the sum of the numbers from 1 to 100.

Now, do all of these problems again with while loops!

Instructor Note: You can write out these problems as comments in the student's code. Make up more variations of these problems until they are able to write for and while loops independently.



class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    // Using a for loop, print the numbers from 1 to 10.
    System.out.println("\nNumbers from 1 to 10: ");
    for(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++){
      System.out.print(i + " ");
    }
    
    // Using a for loop, print the even numbers from 2 to 10.
    System.out.println("\n\nEven numbers from 1 to 10: ");
    for(int i = 2; i <= 10; i += 2){
      System.out.print(i + " ");
    }

    // Using a for loop, print the numbers from 10 to 1.
    System.out.println("\n\nNumbers from 10 to 1: ");
    for(int i = 10; i >= 1; i--){
      System.out.print(i + " ");
    }

    // Using a for loop (and an extra variable), find the sum of the numbers from 1 to 100.
    System.out.println("\n\nSum of the numbers from 1 to 100: ");
    int sum = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i <= 100; i++){
      sum += i;
    }
    System.out.print(sum);

    // Now, do all of these problems again with while loops!

    System.out.println("\n\nNumbers from 1 to 10: ");
    int i = 1;
    while(i <= 10){
      System.out.print(i + " ");
      i++;
    }

    System.out.println("\n\nEven numbers from 1 to 10: ");
    i = 2;
    while(i <= 10){
      System.out.print(i + " ");
      i += 2;
    }

    System.out.println("\n\nNumbers from 10 to 1: ");
    i = 10;
    while(i >= 1){
      System.out.print(i + " ");
      i--;
    }

    System.out.println("\n\nSum of the numbers from 1 to 100: ");
    i = 0;
    sum = 0;
    while(i <= 100){
      sum += i;
      i++;
    }
    System.out.print(sum);

  }
}
