Have the computer pick a random lowercase letter. Ask the user to guess the letter. Keep asking until the user guesses correctly. 
At the end, print out how many guesses it took for the user to guess the letter correctly.

One tricky thing in this project is that we are storing our letter as a char, and when we call in.nextLine() to read in the user's guess, it reads in a String.
Show the student how to use line.charAt(0) to get the character out of the user's input.



import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int n = (int)(Math.random()*26+97);
    char letter = (char)n;

    Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
    int numGuesses = 0;

    while (true) {
      System.out.print("Guess a random letter (lowercase)! ");
      String line = in.nextLine();
      char guess = line.charAt(0);
      numGuesses++;

      if (guess == letter) {
        System.out.println("You got it! It took you " + numGuesses + " guesses to guess correctly.");
        break;
      } else {
        System.out.println("That\'s not it!");
      }
    }

  }
}
