Today, we're going to learn how to use Java to generate a random number or letter. Have the student print out the result of Math.random().
What do you think this does? It always picks a number between 0 and 1. (To be specific, it is inclusive of 0 but exclusive of 1, which means it will never print out 1 exactly.)

What if we want a random number between 0 and 10? What should we do to the result of Math.random()? We should multiply it by 10.

What if we want the number to always be an integer? Show the student how to use (int) to cast (or convert) our number to an integer.

What if we want a random number between 5 and 15? What should we do to the result of (int)(Math.random()*10)? We should add 5 to it.

Use what we have just learned (and loops) to print out ten random integers between 0 and 20.

Now, print out five random integers between 1000 and 2000. Make up more similar exercises for the student as necessary.

In order to learn about how to generate random letters, we have to learn about ASCII. ASCII is a language in which every possible letter (or character) is represented by a number.
This standard ensures that computers can communicate to each other about characters properly. You can show the student an ASCII table online.
For example, the letter a is 97 in ASCII, the letter A is 65, and the character space is 32.

This means in order to generate a random lowercase letter, we have to generate a random integer between 97 (which is ASCII for a)
and 122 (which is ASCII for z). Have the student write the code to do this and store the integer in a variable.

Now, we just need to cast that number to a char, just like how we learned to cast to an integer.

Use what we have just learned (and loops) to print out five random lowercase letters.

Write a program that prints out 100 random 3-letter "words" (which are just random combinations of random letters). It will be fun to see how many of these form real words!
