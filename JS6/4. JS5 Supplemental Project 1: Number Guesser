Program a number guessing game! Ask the user for a minimum and maximum possible value for the secret number.
Then, randomly choose a number in this range. Have the user keep guessing numbers, telling them whether their number is too low or too high,
until they guess the random number. Once they guess, tell them how many tries it took them to guess.



import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.println("Welcome to the random number guesser!");	
    System.out.println();

    System.out.println("First, give me the range in which I can guess.");
    System.out.print("Minimum value: ");
    int min = scanner.nextInt();
    System.out.print("Maximum value: ");
    int max = scanner.nextInt();
    System.out.println();

    System.out.println("OK, let me think of a random number in between " + min + " and " + max + ".");
    int rand = (int)(Math.random() * (max-min+1)) + min; 
    System.out.println("...");
    System.out.println("I have a random number in mind. Try and guess it!");
    int guesses = 0;
    System.out.println();

    while(true) {

      System.out.print("Your guess: ");
      int guess = scanner.nextInt();
      guesses++;

      if(guess == rand) {
        System.out.println("You guessed it! My random number was " + rand + ". It took you " + guesses + " tries to guess my number.");
        break;
      } else if(guess > rand) {
        System.out.println("Nope! Your guess is too high. Try again!");
        System.out.println();
      } else {
