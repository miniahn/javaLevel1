Let's create a chatbot we can talk to! We are going to program the computer to ask different questions and respond appropriately to the user's response.

For example, the chatbot can start by asking, "What is your name?" and respond by saying, "Nice to meet you, [name]!"

The chatbot can also ask, "What is your favorite food?" and respond by saying, "Aw man, I'm allergic to [food]!

Program your chatbot to ask and respond to at least five questions.



import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);

    System.out.print("What is your name? ");
    String name = in.nextLine();
    System.out.println("Nice to meet you, " + name + "! My name is Bob.");

    System.out.print("What is your favorite food? ");
    String food = in.nextLine();
    System.out.println("Aw man, I'm allergic to " + food + ". :(");

    System.out.print("What's the best movie you've seen lately? ");
    String movie = in.nextLine();
    System.out.println("Cool, I'll add that one to my list!");

    System.out.print("Who is your favorite celebrity? ");
    String celeb = in.nextLine();
    System.out.println("You won't believe this, but I just met " + celeb + " last week!");

    System.out.println("See you next time!");
  }
}
