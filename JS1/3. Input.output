We've already learned how to print things out in Java, but what if we want to get input from the user? There are four steps:
First, we import the Scanner class to help us, by adding import java.util.Scanner; to the top of our program.

Then, we create our Scanner variable. Inside our main code, we can create a variable called in with Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);. This means our Scanner is going to be using the input typed into the console.

Next, we ask our user the question we want to answer by using System.out.print("What is your name? ");. Notice that if we use System.out.print() instead of println(),
and we add a space to the end of our question string, we can type in the answer right next to the question.

Finally, we get the answer by creating a string and storing it: String answer = in.nextLine();.
