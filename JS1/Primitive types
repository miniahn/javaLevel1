Primitive types in Java are built-in data types that can be stored inside variables. The four primitive types we will discuss today are int, double, char, and boolean.

An int is an integer. Have the student initialize an int variable with int x = 5;. Notice that every time we create a new variable in Java, we have to start with its type, but we don't have to state the type when we use the variable again.
Then, have the student print out the value of the variable: System.out.println(x);.

A double is a decimal number. Have the student initialize a double with double y = 3.0;. Then, have the student print out the value of the variable: System.out.println(y);. Notice that every line of code in Java must end in a semicolon!

A char is a character, like a letter, number, or punctuation. Have the student initialize a char with char z = 'a';. Then, have the student print out the value of the variable: System.out.println(z);. Note that in Java, chars are wrapped in single quotes.

A boolean stores either true or false. Have the student initialize a boolean with boolean isCold = false;. Then, have the student print out the value of the variable: System.out.println(isCold);.



class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int x = 5;
    System.out.println(x);

    double y = 2.0;
    System.out.println(y);

    char z = 'a';
    System.out.println(z);

    boolean isCold = false;
    System.out.println(isCold);
  }
}
