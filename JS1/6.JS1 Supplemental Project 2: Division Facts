A math teacher needs your help! He needs you to write a program that, given two inputted numbers, can calculate the quotient as well as the remainder.
He wants you to print out, "__ divided by __ equals __ with a remainder of __." Note: You are not allowed to use the %operator!



import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
		Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.print("Type in the first number: ");
		int dividend = s.nextInt();
		System.out.print("Type in the second number: ");
		int divisor = s.nextInt();

		int quotient = dividend / divisor;
		int remainder = dividend - divisor * quotient;

		System.out.println(divisor + " divided by " + dividend + " equals " + quotient + " with a remainder of " + remainder + ".");
  }
}
