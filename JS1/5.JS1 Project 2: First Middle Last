Ask the user for a word and then print out the first, middle, and last characters!

Instructor Note: This project focuses on the charAt() method. If you'd also like to practice with substrings,
a great extension would be to print out three different strings that modify the original word: one with the first letter removed,
one with the middle letter removed, and one with the last letter removed!



import java.util.*;

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

    System.out.println("\nI'll print out the first, middle, and last characters!");
    System.out.print("Enter a word: ");
    String word = scanner.nextLine();
    int midpoint = word.length()/2;

    System.out.print("First-Middle-Last: ");
    System.out.print(word.charAt(0) + "-");
    System.out.print(word.charAt(midpoint) + "-");
    System.out.print(word.charAt(word.length()-1));
    System.out.println("");

  }
}
