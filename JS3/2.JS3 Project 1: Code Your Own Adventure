brainstorm a plot for their own Choose Your Own Adventure game.

In this project, discuss with the student conditionals can be nested, meaning we can place an if-then statement inside of another.



import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("You wake up and find yourself on a hard wooden bench. You're in a tiny room - you look up and see a door with metal bars running down it. Do you *peek* out the door or do you *yell* to see if anyone is out there?");

    Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
    String action = in.nextLine();

    if (action.equals("peek")) {
      System.out.println("You see another room! There's a person in there watching TV. Do you *watch* to see what's on TV or do you *look around* the room some more?");

      action = in.nextLine();

      if (action.equals("look around")) {
        System.out.println("You examine every nook and cranny of this tiny room. All you find is dust, until you're feeling around under the bench. You feel a handle, and with a slight tug, a hole opens up in the ground and you start falling right through it!\n\nYou land on a soft spot, right back on your bed. Phew! :)");
