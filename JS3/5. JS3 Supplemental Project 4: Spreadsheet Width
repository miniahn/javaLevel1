Write a program that correctly prints out how a word would look in a spreadsheet cell with a given width. 
First, have the user input both the number of characters wide the spreadsheet cell is, and the word. 
Then, determine whether the word will fit, and either pad or cut off the word accordingly. 
For example, if the string is “conditionals” and the width is 5, then the final string will be |condi| with the left and right “|” representing the edges of the spreadsheet. 
Or, if the string is “hi” and the width is 5, then the final string will be |hi   |. Make sure to add “|” to the start and end of the final string!



import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		System.out.print("How many characters wide is each cell of the spreadsheet? ");
		int width = s.nextInt();

		System.out.print("Type in the string: ");
		String string = s.next();

		String finalString = "|";
		int length = string.length();
		
		if(length < width) {
			finalString += string;
			for(int i = length; i < width; i++) {
				finalString += " ";
			}
		} else {
			finalString += string.substring(0, width);
		}
		
		finalString += "|";
    
		System.out.println(finalString);
	}
}
