onditional statements are if... else if... else statements. Show the student an example, and explain how only one code path can be chosen.

The conditions inside conditional statements involve these operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, and <=. Make sure the student understands what these operators mean.

Multiple conditions can be combined with ! (not), && (and), and || (or). Try writing some examples with the student. Note that && has precedence over ||.

Note that for strings specifically, we do not use str1 == str2 to compare strings. Instead, we use str1.equals(str2).
