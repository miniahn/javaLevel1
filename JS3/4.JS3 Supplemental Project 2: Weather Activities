Write a program that asks the user what the weather is today. Based on their answer, print out an activity to do given the weather.
For example, if the user says “sunny” then the program might print “Go to the beach!”
If the user types in a weather condition the program does not know about, make sure to print something out as well.



import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
		Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.print("What is the weather today? ");
		String weather = s.nextLine();

		if(weather.equals("sunny")) {
			System.out.println("Swim and relax at the beach!");
		} else if(weather.equals("rainy")) {
			System.out.println("Stay at home and read a book!");
		} else if(weather.equals("cloudy")) {
			System.out.println("Go to the movie theather!");
		} else if(weather.equals("snowy")) {
			System.out.println("Go skiing or snowboarding!");
		} else {
			System.out.println("Sorry, I'm not sure what you should do today!");
		}
  }
}
