Arrays are helpful, but they have a lot of limitations.
  For example, we can’t change the size of an array after we create it, and there are no built in methods for inserting, deleting, or printing elements.
  If we wanted to insert or delete an element, we would have to manually shift all the necessary elements.

ArrayLists were built to solve these problems.
  ArrayLists have no fixed length and they have methods for insertion, deletion, and printing.
  In order to use ArrayLists we have to import them into our project by typing: import java.util.ArrayList;

ArrayLists must contain objects instead of primitive types (int, double, boolean, etc.). If we want to store these primitive types we can use the corresponding wrapper object.

use add(), get(), set(), and remove()
