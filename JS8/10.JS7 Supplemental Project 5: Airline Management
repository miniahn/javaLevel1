Transatlantic Airlines needs your help in managing its reservation system.
Its smallest airplane has five seats, and we will use a boolean array to represent whether each seat has been reserved ("true" means the seat has been booked, and "false" means the seat has not been reserved). 
Write a program that continuously asks the user which seat they would like to reserve (between 1-5), lets the user know in the case that seat has already been reserved, and repeats until all seats are reserved.

In this program, you will need to write two methods: isFull() returns true if all seats have been reserved, and false otherwise.
reserveSeat() takes in a seat number and reserves that seat if it is not already reserved (the method returns true if it is able to reserve that seat, and false otherwise).
Be sure to note that the seat numbers start at 1, not 0!



import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.println("Welcome to Transatlantic Airlines!");
    boolean[] seats = new boolean[5];

    while(true) {

      if(isFull(seats)) {
        break;
      }

      System.out.print("Which seat would you like to book? Pick a seat number between 1 and 5: ");
      int seatNumber = s.nextInt();

      if(reserveSeat(seatNumber, seats)) {
        System.out.println("Perfect! Your seat has been booked!\n");
      } else {
        System.out.println("Sorry, that seat has already been reserved.\n");
      }

    }

    System.out.println("The plane is ready for take-off! Thanks for flying with Transatlantic Airlines!");

  }

  public static boolean reserveSeat(int seatNumber, boolean[] seats) {
    if(seats[seatNumber-1]) { // seat is already reserved
      return false;
    } else { // not already reserved, so reserve the seat
      seats[seatNumber-1] = true;
      return true;
    }
  }

  public static boolean isFull(boolean[] seats) {
    for(int i = 0; i < seats.length; i++) {
      if(seats[i] == false) {
        return false;
      }
    }
    return true;
  }
}
