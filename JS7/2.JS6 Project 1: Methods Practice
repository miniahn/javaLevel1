Write a method that takes in two integers and returns their average. Make sure the average is precise and not rounded!

Write a method that takes in an integer and returns true if the number is even and false if the number is odd.

Write a method that takes in three distinct doubles and returns the smallest double.

Write a method that takes in an integer and returns its factorial. (You may have to explain factorials.)

Write a method that takes in a base and a power and returns the value of the base raised to that power.
