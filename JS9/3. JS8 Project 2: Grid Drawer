Create a program that prints out a 10x10 grid and continuously asks the user to pick a row index and a column index and places an x in that position. 
The user can use this program to draw a pattern, like a heart or a smiley face, in the grid. The program should print out the updated grid each time, and it should stop when the user enters -1.

You may need to show the student how to use s.nextInt(); for the Scanner object to read in an integer input from the user.

For bonus, the student can print out the row and column indices with the grid to make the drawer easier to use.
They can also have the program ask the user at the beginning for the dimensions of the grid.



import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    boolean[][] grid = new boolean[10][10];
    Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);

    while(true) {
      printGrid(grid);

      System.out.println("Which row do you want to draw in? (To stop drawing, enter -1)");
      int row = s.nextInt();

      System.out.println("Which column do you want to draw in? (To stop drawing, enter -1)");
      int col = s.nextInt();

      if (row == -1 || col == -1) {
        break;
      }

      grid[row][col] = true;
    }
  }

  public static void printGrid(boolean[][] grid) {
    System.out.print("  ");
    for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
      System.out.print(i + " ");
    }
    System.out.println();

    for(int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++){
      System.out.print(i + " ");

      for(int j = 0; j< grid[0].length; j++){
        if(grid[i][j] == true){
          System.out.print("x" + " ");
        }
        else{
          System.out.print("-" + " ");
        }
      }
      System.out.println();
    }
  }
}
