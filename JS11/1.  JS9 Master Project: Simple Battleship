The Master Project for this course is to program Battleship! Have the student play through the demo and plan out the project.
Careful planning and code commenting will be helpful for a more complex project like this one.

Discuss the different data structures we will need to store where the battleships are and where there have been hits.
  Also discuss how the code will be structured to allow the player to continuously guess until they sink all of the ships.
  Have the student consider what functionality might make sense to break out into separate methods.

Try to have the student work as independently on this project as they can.
  They can add their own modifications, like printing out the number of guesses it took to sink all of the ships at the end.
